Welcome to my website! You might be interested in my background and experiences, so I below present my CV. You can also find a [PDF version here](https://marcusbotacin.github.io/files/cv.pdf) (Last Update: Mar/2025)

Warning
======

I'm not advertising positions by email or Whatsapp. If you receive a call from a non-TAMU email, it is not official.

Announcements
======
I have started a new position at [CSE@TAMU](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/profiles/botacin-marcus.html). I'm looking for new Ph.D., Masters, and undergraduate students! [Check the research ideas and prospective students page](https://marcusbotacin.github.io/research/)

New grant on hardware-assisted malware detection. Check it [here](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2327427&HistoricalAwards=false) [TAMU News](https://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2023/08/innovative-approach-detecting-malware-through-hardware-integrated-protection.html)

New grant on LLMs for security. Check it [here](https://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2025/02/chatgpt-for-computer-security.html)

Looking for a brief overview of my research? Check these [slides](https://marcusbotacin.github.io/files/research_overview_botacin.pdf) (or [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W1krbwVlj-VPuBThw_t7_LMMlhHdDY0q/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113059293974706583528&rtpof=true&sd=true))

I will teach my cybersecurity course under the data science umbrella this Fall. Please, enroll into CSCE 704-602. My approach will be similar to what I did in previous semesters.
