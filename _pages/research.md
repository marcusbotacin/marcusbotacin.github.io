Does my research work interest you? Do you want to work with me? Take a look at these overall recommendations and suggestions for research ideas.

# Prospective Students

* I have funded positions for Ph.D. students. You don't need to email me in advance. You can apply directly via the university website. I will invite students who mention me in their applications and/or any other students who have a security background for an interview in the appropriate time.

* I recommend you to email me if you are a special case, like a self-funded Ph.D. student and/or Post-Doc candidate.

* Master students must be enrolled in the program before electing me as dissertation supervisor. If you are already a master student, reach me out for scheduling an interview. If you are a prospective student, enroll in the master program first. Notice that master students are usually self-funded, even though I can pay complementary research hours for students writing their dissertations with me, depending upon our agreement.

* If you are an enrolled undergraduate student and want to have your first research experience, reach me out. I can attest your research experience even if you are a voluntary. It will be my pleasure to recommend you for a graduate program if we have a great research experience.

# Research Ideas

I following present a (non-exhaustive) list of research topics/questions that I have been working with and/or would like to work on:

## Malware
* Longitudinal analyses of in-the-wild threats.
* Static and Dynamic detection mechanisms.
* Sandbox development.
* Malware analysis frameworks.
* Fuzzing and Symbolic execution of malware samples.

## Debuggers
* Development of new debuggers.
* How analysts use debuggers to reverse engineer code?
* Debugger enhancement with AI.

## Anti-Viruses (AVs)
* Metrics to evaluate real solutions.
* Design of next-gen solutions.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML)
* Development of ML models for malware detection.
* Evaluation of ML-based solutions in actual scenarios.
* Adversarial ML attacks against malware detectors.
* Using AI to automatically create new malware samples.

## Hardware
* How to move AVs from software to hardware?
* Development of secure-by-design systems.

## Theoretical Aspects
* What is a good definition for malware?
* Developing a theory of maliciousness.

## Methodological Aspects
* Challenges and Pitfalls in the security field.
* Development of good evaluation metrics.
* Bibliographic analysis of the malware literature.

## Operating Systems
* Resilient and Self-healing systems.

## Data Science and Analytics
* Similar malware clustering.
* Threat intelligence from malware logs.
