Corvus is a dynamic analysis system for malware targeting Windows, Linux, Android and PDFs. Behavioral heuristics and Machine Learning techniques are also applied to identify suspicious activities exhibited by unknown programs. It is a platform used to showcase the outcomes of my research projects. It has been used as groundtruth for the experiments reported in many of my research papers.
