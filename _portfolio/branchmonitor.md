The Branch Monitor Framework (BMF) is an alternative for runtime process monitoring on modern (Windows) systems. It makes use of Branch Trace Store (BTS) from Intel's processors to implement a dynamic, transparent framework. The framework provides many analysis facilities, such as function call tracing and Control Flow Graph (CFG) reconstruction. It is an experimental academic project with no warranty, use at your own risk! [Link Here](https://github.com/marcusbotacin/BranchMonitoringProject)
