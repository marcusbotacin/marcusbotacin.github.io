What to expect from this course?

The educational approach will be inspired from:

* Reverse Engineering
* Exploit Development
* Capture-the-flags (CTF)

The content will cover typical vulnerabilities in:

* Linux servers.
* Android Apps.
* Web Apps.

The projects will be hand-on. Students are expected to be able to find vulnerabilities in real apps.

Covered content:

    * What is Security: ACID Properties.
* Web Security:
    * OWASP Top-10 Web.
    * Directory Traversal.
    * Google Dorks.
    * Replay Attacks.
    * Authentication Failures.
    * Web Vulnerability Scanners.
    * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    * SQL Injection.
* Network Security:
    * Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) Attacks.
