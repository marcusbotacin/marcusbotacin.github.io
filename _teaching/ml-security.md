In this course, we will navigate through the applications of ML in the security field: the pros, the cons, and the future yet to come.

## What to expect

* Lots of malware analysis stuff (50% of the course).
* Discussions about ML limits in general.
* To be requested to map the introduced concepts to your own work.

## Topics

* Pitfalls of ML, dataset size, generalization, and more.
* Malware detection, streams, concept drift.
* Adversarial ML (attacks and defenses)
* Biometrics, Authentication, and related applications.
* Large Language Models, GPT-3, and other fun stuff.

## Evaluation/Format
	
* Seminar presentation + competition

### The competition

Let's make a small version of the [MLSEC](mlsec.io) competition, with students playing together to create attacks and defenses.

## Official Course Link

TAMU students can already enroll in CSCE689 via the Howdy! system.

## Course Progress

* Topic 1.1 [Machine Learning for Malware Detection](https://media.kaspersky.com/en/enterprise-security/Kaspersky-Lab-Whitepaper-Machine-Learning.pdf)
    * Concepts:
        - Static vs. Dynamic analysis.
        - Endpoint vs. Cloud-based strategies.
        - Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH).
        - The role of AV updates.
        - AV scans in the cloud.
        - Non-negative Neural Networks (NNs) against evasion.
    * Outcomes: 
  	- The student Sidhart Baveja created a blog on ML for security. [Check it here](https://ml-to-cs.sidharthbaveja.com/)
	- The student Sidharth Anil created a mind map for this paper. [Check it here](https://gitmind.com/app/docs/mo1h217e)

* Topic 1.2 [Malware Detection on Highly Imbalanced Data through Sequence Modeling](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3338501.3357374)
    * Concepts:
        - Traditional Machine Learning (ML) vs. Deep Learning (DL) algorithms.
        - Imbalance in endpoint files vs. Imbalance in malware repositories.
        - Malware detection as a Natural Language Processing (NLP) problem.
        - The need for having very low False Positives (FPs).
    * Outcomes:
        - The student Soumyajyoti Dutta has been coding some examples on imbalanced data. [Check it here](https://github.com/Soumyajyotidutta/MLProjects/blob/main/MLCyber.ipynb)
