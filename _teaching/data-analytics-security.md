I will teach my cybersecurity course under the data science umbrella this Fall. Please, enroll into CSCE 704-602. My approach will be similar to what I did in previous semesters. Take a look [here](https://marcusbotacin.github.io/teaching/ml-1)

We added a few new topics this semester, as follows:

* Topic 1.2 [Humans vs. Machines in Malware Classification](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/aonzo)
    * Concepts:
        - Malware definitions.
        - Maliciousness vs. Behaviors.
        - Explainability and Feature Selection.
        - Obfuscation and PE resources.
    * Outcomes (2024):
        - The student Mahbub Alam created a blog on ML for security. [Check it here](https://itsmahbub.github.io/machine-learning-in-malware-detection/)

* Topic 4.4 [Adversarial Training for Raw-Binary Malware Classifiers](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/lucas) and [Moving Target Defense against Adversarial Machine Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3474370.3485662)
    * Concepts:
        - TBD
