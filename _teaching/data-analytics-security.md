I will teach my cybersecurity course under the data science umbrella this Fall. Please, enroll into CSCE 704-602. My approach will be similar to what I did in previous semesters. Take a look [here](https://marcusbotacin.github.io/teaching/ml-1)

We added a few new topics this semester, as follows:

* Topic 1.2 [Humans vs. Machines in Malware Classification](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/aonzo)
    * Concepts:
        - Malware definitions.
        - Maliciousness vs. Behaviors.
        - Explainability and Feature Selection.
        - Obfuscation and PE resources.
    * Outcomes (2024):
        - The student Mahbub Alam created a blog on ML for security. [Check it here](https://itsmahbub.github.io/machine-learning-in-malware-detection/)

* Topic 4.4 [Adversarial Training for Raw-Binary Malware Classifiers](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/lucas) and [Moving Target Defense against Adversarial Machine Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3474370.3485662)
    * Concepts:
        - Adversarial Retraining.
        - Moving Target Defenses (MTD).

* Topic 5.5 [GPThreats-3: Is Automatic Malware Generation a Threat?](https://marcusbotacin.github.io/publication/2023-05-01-paper-gpt-number-27)
    * Concepts:
        - Divide-and-Conquer and Malware Building Blocks.
        - Prompt Engineering and Jailbreaking.
        - Efficiency vs. Effectiveness.
        - Server-side polymorphism.
        - Attack-as-a-Service

* Topic 7.1 [Lookin' Out My Backdoor! Investigating Backdooring Attacks Against DL-driven Malware Detectors](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3605764.3623919)
    * Concepts:
	- Backdoor: Poisoning and Label-Flipping.
        - Spaces: Feature, Problem, and Latent Spaces.
	- STRIP Defense.

* Topic 7.2 [Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03817)
    * Concaepts:
        - GDPR
	- Machine Unlearning
	- Backdoor Purification
	- Access Control
	- K-anonymization

## New Topics (2025)

* Topic 5.1 was brokedown in two paper versions: [Asleep at the Keyboard? Assessing the Security of GitHub Copilot's Code Contributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09293) and [Lost at C: A User Study on the Security Implications of Large Language Model Code Assistants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09727)
* Topic 5.7 now covers: [AutoAttacker: A Large Language Model Guided System to Implement Automatic Cyber-attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09727)
    * Concaepts:
        - What is penetration testing? How LLMs can help with it?
        - What are agent systems? Why do we need agents for LLMs?
        - What are RAG systems? Why do LLMs need it?
        - What is the difference of using LLMs as orchestrators and as exploit writters?

## Outcomes (2025)

* The team (Mabon Ninan, Uros Stanic, Sandali Srivastava, Jess Cadena) contributed with two Wikipedia edits:
    * [Concept Drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_drift)
    * [ML-Based AVs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software#Machine_Learning_Detection)
